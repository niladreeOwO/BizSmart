## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#4CAF50), providing a sense of growth and financial health.
- Background color: Light green (#E8F5E9), a very desaturated hue, brightness appropriate for a light scheme, allowing the other design elements to stand out.
- Accent color: Darker, brighter, and more saturated bluish-green (#00796B) for actionable elements, to draw attention.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a modern-looking yet humanist sans-serif that can be used in both headlines and body copy.
- Use a responsive, card-based layout that adapts to both mobile and desktop screens.
- Use material design icons to provide context for different types of transactions and categories.
